There is no cost for the trip as this is being covered by the school but they may wish to bring money for souvenirs and lunch or alternatively they should bring a packed lunch. Students need to wear school uniform and be ready to leave at 8am from the bus bay at the front of the school. Students are expected to return at 6pm the same day."
